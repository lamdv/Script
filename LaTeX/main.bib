    abstract = {Author Summary Recently there has been much interest in combining multiple genetic markers into a single score for predicting disease risk. Even if many of the individual markers have no detected effect, the combined score could be a strong predictor of disease. This has allowed researchers to demonstrate that some diseases have a strong genetic basis, even if few actual genes have been identified, and it has also revealed a common genetic basis for distinct diseases. These analyses have so far been performed opportunistically, with mixed results. Here I derive formulae based on the heritability of disease and size of the study, allowing researchers to plan their analyses from a more informed position. I show that discouraging results in some previous studies were due to the low number of subjects studied, but a modest increase in study size would allow more successful analysis. However, I also show that, for genetics to become useful for predicting individual risk of disease, hundreds of thousands of subjects may be needed to estimate the gene effects. This is larger than most existing studies, but will become more common in the near future, so that gene scores will become more useful for predicting disease than has appeared to date.},

	abstract = {Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) has substantial heritability and a polygenic architecture. However, the potential of genomic risk scores to help predict CAD outcomes has not been evaluated comprehensively, because available studies have involved limited genomic scope and limited sample sizes.Objectives This study sought to construct a genomic risk score for CAD and to estimate its potential as a screening tool for primary prevention.Methods Using a meta-analytic approach to combine large-scale, genome-wide, and targeted genetic association data, we developed a new genomic risk score for CAD (metaGRS) consisting of 1.7 million genetic variants. We externally tested metaGRS, both by itself and in combination with available data on conventional risk factors, in 22,242 CAD cases~and 460,387 noncases from the UK Biobank.Results The hazard ratio (HR) for CAD was 1.71 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68 to 1.73) per SD increase in metaGRS, an association larger than any other externally tested genetic risk score previously published. The metaGRS stratified individuals into significantly different life course trajectories of CAD risk, with those in the top 20\% of metaGRS distribution having an HR of 4.17 (95\% CI: 3.97 to 4.38) compared with those in the bottom 20\%. The corresponding HR~was 2.83 (95\% CI: 2.61 to 3.07) among individuals on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications. The metaGRS had a higher C-index (C~=~0.623; 95\% CI: 0.615 to 0.631) for incident CAD than any of 6 conventional factors (smoking,~diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, self-reported high cholesterol, and family history). For men in the~top 20\% of metaGRS with \&gt;2 conventional factors, 10\% cumulative risk of CAD was reached by 48 years of age.Conclusions The genomic score developed and evaluated here substantially advances the concept of using genomic~information to stratify individuals with different trajectories of CAD risk and highlights the potential for~genomic~screening in early life to complement conventional risk prediction.},
